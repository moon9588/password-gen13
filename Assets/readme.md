This weeks assigment was to create a password generator using JavaScript. We needed to make sure that the new password provided greater security with the option whether or not a individual wants to add uppercase or lowercase letter, numbers and special characters.

something that where added to Java
1. add password array
2. shuffle array
3. added var elements 
4. 

some of the challenges that I encountered were
1. Once I finish my code some of my pop-ups weren't popping up anymore
2. My password wouldn't show up on the web  once I click generate password
