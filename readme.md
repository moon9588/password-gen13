This weeks assigment was to create a password generator using JavaScript. We needed to make sure that the new password provided greater security with the option whether or not a individual wants to add uppercase or lowercase letter, numbers and special characters.

something that where added to Java where
1. password array
2. shuffle array
3. var elements 
4. window prompt
5. window alert
6. button click

Some of the challenges that I encountered were
1. Once I finish my code some of my pop-ups weren't popping up anymore. Then when I went back I made alot of syntax errors.
2. My password wouldn't show up on the web  once I click generate password
